Please note the followings:

Please note the followings:
1) We do segmentation for all Chinese sentence in sample data using ICTCLAS2011,
   which you can down load from http://ictclas.org/ictclas_download.aspx.
2) The following process has been done for English sentences:
   2.1) Tokenization
   2.2) Upper case is folded to lowercase (except “e.txt.keepcase” in TM-training-set)
3) After segmentation, all of words in Chinese sentence are separated by Spaces.
4) The file “AlignedTable.txt” of TM-training-set is the word Alignment result of “c.txt” and “e.txt”.
   Here, Chinese is the source language. The format of “AlignedTable.txt” is s_pos_id-t_pos_id.
     For example:
        the line 105 of the file "AlignedTable.txt" is "0-0 0-1 2-2 3-2 4-8 4-9 5-6 6-4 6-5 7-10"
        the line 105 of the file "c.txt" is "爱尔兰 人 过去 用 马铃薯 作为 主食 ."
        the line 105 of the file "e.txt" is "the irish used to live on a diet of potatoes ."
        "0-1" means "爱尔兰" in chinses sentence is linked to "irish" in the corresponding English sentence.
        And s_pos_id and t_pos_id are all start from 0.
        NOTE: the word alignment result is the output of GIZA++,
        which you can get from http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/downloads/list.
